[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/lue2eapuxift9or7/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AlexEyler/fuslogvw2/branch/master)

## Synopsis

This project is designed to be a spiritual successor to the current [fuslogvw](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e74a18c4.aspx) (a.k.a. Assembly Binding Log Viewer). Using the same settings as fuslogvw, Fuslogvw 2 provides a more user-friendly GUI for examining assembly binding failures.

## Motivation

The original Fuslogvw.exe has a very outdated UI, with many usability issues, including:

1. No search/filter functionality
2. Cannot order columns
3. Not resizable

## Installation
